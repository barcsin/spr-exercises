# Statistical Pattern Recognition exercises 

This code repository contains the exercises for the [Statistical Pattern recognition Course](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/lectures/spr/).

Exercise templates can be found in the `templates` directory. They will be in jupyter notebook format. Solutions will become availabe on the course website in a delayed basis. The `data` directory contains small datasets that your will need for different excercies.
